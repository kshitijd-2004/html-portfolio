<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Kshitij, a 20 year old Computer Science major at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I just finished my sophomore year 
  and now I am learning frontend web development over the summer! I'm currently aiming to be a full stack developer but I would like
  to work in machine learning someday in the future.
</p>
<p>Some of the languages I know include Python, Java and Javascript and also certain web dev languages such as HTML and CSS.
  My most favorite language is Python due to how easy it is to  write code as well as the extensive libraries that are available to python.
  Also, when it comes to machine learning, Python is the king. Some Python libraries that I have used or am familiar with are NumPy, Tensorflow,
  PyTorch, Pandas, Statsmodels and many more.  
</p>

<p>My work experience includes an internship I am doing over the summer where I build statistical time series models
  to predict cloud spend for businesses. In a world where the usage of the cloud is inevitable, it is crucial that businesses
  spend only on what they need to minimize their spending and maximize their output based on what they are trying to achieve. 
  By building a prediction model that can predict their spend for the next 30 days, businesses can better understand their spend patterns
  and identify any areas where they can minimize spend.
